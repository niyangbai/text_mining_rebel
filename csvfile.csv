1002		Oxwash, a green tech startup from Oxford, has just raised €590k in equity investment and secured 320 new investors through crowdfunding platform Crowdcube, in only 15 hours. This follows a capital increase of €2.46 million in June 2021 by the fast-growing company. Investors such as Biz Stone (Twitter co-founder) and Future Positive Capital (behind Pinterest and Beyond Meat), are backing the sustainable on-demand laundry service offered by Oxwash. The startup, founded in 2018 byex-NASA scientist and Forbes Europe’s 30 under 30 alumni, Dr Kyle Grant and Oxford engineer Tom de Wilton, has the vision to achieve net-zero carbon emissions for the whole laundry process – from collection, through to washing, back to delivery. Oxwash CEO, Dr Kyle Grant, said:“Our goal was to build a wide network of shareholders who care about our purpose as much as we do and can be true ambassadors for the brand, which is why we capped the investment level at £5,000 per person. To witness £100k pledged in just three hours, and be able to close the round in fifteen, we are over the moon with the outcome and level of support. We know being just another laundry app will not cut it. Developing a model that is hyper local, carbon neutral and tech enabled – that reverses the sector’s adverse impact on the planet rather than adding to it is absolutely critical”.	<triplet> Oxwash <sub> €590k <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> crowdfunding <sub> €590k <obj> INVESTS

105		With the aim to help mobile apps boost customer retention,Cooee has just received €356k in pre-seed funding. The funding was led by Jenson Funding Partners with participation from several angel investors from the United States, India and UK. The deeptech startup, founded in 2020, delivers one-to-one personalised in-app and push notifications that help businesses increase revenue and reduce churn. Cooee uses AR, computer vision and machine learning to create unique engagements for every customer in real-time rather than the traditional approach of bucketing different users in finite segments and delivering campaigns on a fixed schedule. It is thought that a record 3.8 trillion hours were spent on apps last year, and, there are now over 5 million apps available on app stores. This is a massive market area. The problem, though, is that many apps are financially unviable because of the high cost of customer acquisition and consequent lack of revenue – this is what Cooee aim to solve.	<triplet> Cooee <sub> €356k <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> Jenson Funding Partners <sub> €356k <obj> INVESTS <triplet> several angel investors <sub> €356k <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Cooee <sub> €356k <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> €356k <sub> pre-seed funding <obj> IN ROUND

Further new investors include Slack Fund, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan, Framer CEO Koen Bok, Elastic Co-Founder Simon Willnauer, Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel, Wunderlist-backer Frank Thelen, and Metalab Founder Andrew Wilkinson.

They impact the lives and businesses of hundreds of millions of users every day, with billions of hours spent on crafting and delivering presentations. Yet the tools widely used today have remained more-or-less within the same paradigm since many years. The existing tools are sometimes a bit complex, sometimes do not integrate with external data sources and have limited collaboration features. Pitch is here to change that.

LiFE Ventures, Toni Nijm of Yobi Partners and Steve Castle of ABC Investors, also joined this round. Co-founded by serial entrepreneur Roei Samuel, Connectd aims to ‘break down barriers’ in early-stage funding by using smart matching technology to put data at the heart of startup investment. Since its launch in February 2020, Connectd has helped almost 100 businesses to raise capital, including an approx. €2.1 million Series A round in the Spring of 2021. Already using the platform are analysts from VCs including 8Roads, Octopus, Piton Capital and Second City Ventures, in addition to over 1000 angel investors, family offices and advisors. Founder Roei Samuel, who sold his first company, an e-sports venture called RealSport, to Gfinity in a multi-million-pound deal at the age of 26, said the pandemic had demonstrated the potential to shake up startup funding: “It is ironic that with all the leaps made by British businesses, the startup space itself has seen very little in the way of innovation. Having founded my own business before investing in startups, I have seen how difficult it is on both sides. If you do not move in traditional circles, it can be very difficult to get access to the capital and outside expertise needed to rapidly scale the business. Similarly, investors can waste hours hopelessly searching for the right opportunity. We see it differently, which is why Connectd brings people together based on what they know, not who they know.”	<triplet> Toni Nijm <sub> €841K <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Steve Castle <sub> €841K <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Nigel Wray <sub> €841K <obj> INVESTS <triplet> LiFE Ventures <sub> €841K <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Connectd <sub> €841K <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> €841K <sub> seed funding round <obj> IN ROUND <triplet> Connectd <sub> €2.1 million <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> €2.1 million <sub> Series A <obj> IN ROUND <triplet> €2.1 million <sub> in the Spring of 2021 <obj> PLACEHOLDER_DATE

Founded by serial entrepreneurs Rahul Goyal and Karan Baweja this year, who recently led product teams at Citymapper and TransferWise respectively, Cosmos is on a mission to enable human connection in the remote era. The past nine months have seen our lives dramatically altered and people are feeling disconnected with their communities as a result. Many interactions have been replaced by monotonous video calls, which can feel mechanical and constrained. In addition, social network feeds have become a hollow proxy for serendipitous conversation in shared spaces. Virtual Reality promised much, and could have given us the sense of being together, but it is not mass consumer ready. At the same time, gaming platforms such as Animal Crossing and Roblox have surged. These digital worlds not only offer a chance to disconnect from the staleness of our day-to-day routines, but also provide a shared space and experience, closely mimicking the real-world interactions.	<triplet> LocalGlobe <sub> €2.2 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Omid Ashtari <sub> €2.2 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Cosmos Video <sub> €2.2 million <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> Andy Chung <sub> €2.2 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Phillip Moehring <sub> €2.2 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Entrepreneur First <sub> €2.2 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> €2.2 million <sub> seed funding <obj> IN ROUND

1243		The high-tech startup NavVis, specialized in the digitalization of indoor spaces, has just announced that it has successfully closed its latest funding round of €7.5 million. Target Partners and Don Dodge (Developer Evangelist at Google) are joining as new investors. MIG Fonds and BayBG are increasing their investments. People take GPS and maps for granted these days, but not indoor spaces. NavVis develops an innovative technology for the mapping and navigation of indoor spaces. The Munich-based company provides the platform for end-to-end digitalization of buildings: Last year NavVis began a partnership with the Deutsches Museum to digitalize its complex exhibition spaces. The customers retain ownership of their data, which was a key criterion in the Deutsches Museum’s decision to collaborate with NavVis. At present, many of the museum’s popular collections are no longer accessible until 2019 due to extensive renovation work. Majority of the building including these closed collections can be explored on a tablet or PC with the NavVis IndoorViewer.

1250		Anyfin, a Stockholm-based fintech startup that enables consumers to refinance their existing loans with a picture, just closed a €4.8 million Series A funding round led by Accel and Northzone. Global Founders Capital and angel investors, including consumer finance executives and international fintech entrepreneurs, also participated in the round. At the point when a loan is originated, lenders have very little access to information about a consumer – particularly around repayment history – and often have a monopoly over their distribution channel. Consequently, many consumers with good credit scores are being overcharged for money they borrow. What is more, the process to refinance existing loans through traditional banks or brokers requires a lot of paperwork and can take weeks. By leveraging more publicly available consumer data and by using AI and modern mobile technology, Anyfin enables consumers to refinance their existing loans within seconds simply by taking a picture of their loan statement. Consumers send Anyfin the picture through a channel of their choice, like SMS, email or Facebook Messenger, and the company replies with an option to refinance the loan at a better price. With one tap, the consumer accepts the new option from Anyfin, and the company takes care of settling the existing loan for them. Aside from a better price, the terms of the new loan mirror those of the existing loan.	<triplet> fintech entrepreneurs <sub> €4.8 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> consumer finance executives <sub> €4.8 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Anyfin <sub> €4.8 million <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> Northzone <sub> €4.8 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Accel <sub> €4.8 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Global Founders Capital <sub> €4.8 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> angel investors <sub> €4.8 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> €4.8 million <sub> Series A <obj> IN ROUND

The company is now creating a product that enables AI teams to build and deploy AI models that are safe, reliable, and trustworthy. Despite great progress over the last decade, current AI models can perform poorly and unpredictably when deployed in the real-world, mounting increasing concerns on their safety and reliability. Such reliability issues affect the use of AI across virtually all domains, such as healthcare, engineering, financial services, autonomous cars, and many others. Petar Tsankov, co-founder and CEO of LatticeFlow, said: “Our mission is to bridge this gap and enable AI teams to build and confidently deploy trustworthy AI models.

167		Wrocław-based Pure Biologics is a biotech startup focused on early-stage development of drug candidates, diagnostic tools and medical devices. The startup has just announced that it is being funded by the National Center for Research and Development with €6.7 million for its PureBIKE project to create an immuno-oncological drug to treat triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Triple-negative breast cancer is a a rare and particularly aggressive form of breast cancer, with a poorer prognosis than other types. Unlike other forms of breast cancer, the triple-negative type is not driven by the hormones estrogen and progesterone, nor by the HER2 protein, and so does not respond to hormonal therapies. So far, scientists have not managed to develop a therapy specifically for TNBC – current treatment options are currently limited to destructive chemotherapy. The PureBIKE project aims to develop a new drug using Pure Biologics’ PureSelect platform for the selection of new antibodies.	<triplet> Pure Biologics <sub> €6.7 million <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> National Center for Research and Development <sub> €6.7 million <obj> INVESTS

Earlier this year Movinga bought the assets of its competitor Move24, which had been filing for bankruptcy, and expanded the business. The startup is aiming for a turnover of more than €30 million this year. Movinga now makes €200 per move – up from just €5 per move in 2016, when the company underwent a crisis, though we predicted its eventual success.

204		Fitbay, the discovery platform that solves the problem of buying clothes online in the wrong size or style, has closed a $2 million seed funding round, lead by New York-based Steadfast Venture Capital and Stockholm-based VC firm, Creandum. This $2 million investment comes just 6 months after Fitbay closed an angel round with Jesper Buch (Founder of Just-Eat) and Creandum. The latest funding will be used to grow both the product team in Copenhagen and the commercial team in New York, and to develop the product and available features even further. This announcement also coincides with the launch of Fitbay’s new iOS app, which allows users to share pictures of themselves with their network of ‘body doubles’, and actually see how items of clothing fit other people with a similar body shape and size to their own. The idea behind Fitbay: The Danish startup wants to remove the “will-it-will not-it fit experience” from online clothes shopping by only showing users clothes that will fit their unique size and shape. Fitbay does this by connecting users with similar body types and style preferences, sorting them into groups so that information on fit and particular brands can be shared with other users who have similar body shapes and tastes. This crowd-sourced feedback allows Fitbay to provide its users with a personalised feed of products that will both fit and flatter their unique body type – all without having to input measurements. Users can also follow their ‘body doubles’, sharing tips and inspiration with others who will have similar experiences with the style, fit and sizing of different brands.	<triplet> Creandum <sub> $2 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Fitbay <sub> $2 million <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> Steadfast Venture Capital <sub> $2 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> $2 million <sub> seed funding round <obj> IN ROUND

Interestingly, one type of robots worked on by this startup, alongside company Boston Dynamics, were the inspiration for the robot dogs from the ‘dystopian future’ series Black Mirror. Founded in 2019, Energy Robotics has launched one of the first commercially available software platforms for industrial applications that combines three essential components of intelligent control of mobile autonomous robots: a hardware-independent robot operating system, a cloud-based fleet management, and an AI-powered data analysis. The robots are used for remote inspection and monitoring, especially in industries with harsh and demanding environments such as the oil, gas and petrochemical industries, but also increasingly in the energy and security industries. The company relies on a SaaS model to do this, offering its software solution and associated IT infrastructure along with hardware from various third-party vendors.

Okredo’s SaaS platform helps SMEs assess the credibility, financial strength and sales potential of new and existing business partners and customers Dealing with delayed payments from customers gives SMEs difficult economic risks. These risks are then often exacerbated by a lack of financial literacy combined with a lack of affordable tools to manage them. Smaller companies are particularly exposed to delayed-payment risk, as they do not tend to have the budgets for expensive credit bureau reporting, human resources for in-house analysis, or financial training to sufficiently vet new and existing partners and customers. With the EU’s Open Data Directive going into effect this year, businesses and other enterprises in member states are now required to report on data points that range from debt loads to changes in the c-suite. While this data is technically now ‘open’ (a work that remains in slow progress), it is actually hosted in different agencies. Some of these agencies are private, and they are under to requirement or obligation to package the datasets in a way that is SME-friendly.	<triplet> Presto Ventures <sub> €1 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Lithuanian Business Angels Fund <sub> €1 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Okredo <sub> €1 million <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> €1 million <sub> seed funding round <obj> IN ROUND

Jeroen Volk, CEO Cevinio, explains their recent name change:“We made a name for ourselves as InvoiceBlox, InvoiceSharing and TBlox. Recently, we profoundly scrutinized our brand and purpose. What is it that we stand for and what is our core mission? We concluded that everything we do is about helping companies perform better by offering smart solutions, breaking routines and removing process redundancies. Our new-found purpose needs a fresh corporate identity that reflects who we are. We felt these changes would not be complete without a new name: Cevinio. It is a smart anagram of the word ‘invoice’; a play on words that mirrors our algorithm in a way.

330		French startup Flitdesk has announced closing a €1 million seed funding round to launch its flexible workspace management platform out of beta. The round was led by prominent angel investors like French businessman Xavier Niel, through his fund Kima Ventures. Flexible workspaces have become the new normal over the past ten years with the growth of remote work, coworking, and hot desking. Companies are trying to design offices adapted to the needs of a flexible workforce. But flexible workspaces are much harder to manage than conventional offices, and unfortunately the toolkit that is available to workplace managers has not evolved much (think: spreadsheets, calendars, post-its) for the last 20 years. Managers need the right tools to boost employee productivity and engagement. That is where Flitdesk comes in. Flitdesk was founded in 2017 to provide an all-in-one solution to workplace managers in their quest for more flexible workspaces. As the brainchild of Julian Dufoulon and Youenn Laumelais, the two had realized that smart buildings should be designed around the needs of users, not the the building infrastructure itself. A typical design brief for a modern workplace includes taking into consideration highly mobile and nomadic work habits, shared group settings, diverse task-based spaces, and variable occupancy periods (sometimes very high).	<triplet> Flitdesk <sub> €1 million <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> Kima Ventures <sub> €1 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> €1 million <sub> seed funding round <obj> IN ROUND

Founded in 2015, Lyvly is a living community, that matches great housemates to quality homes. The company addresses the need for community, convenience and affordability in the urban rental experience. It is designed to remove pain-points for both landlords and renters, (who they refer to as members).

All Lyvly homes are fully furnished, right down to the teaspoon in the kitchen drawer. For landlords, Lyvly finds and vets high quality potential renters who stay for the long term, and provides them with property management services. Due to the community and members’ experience, Lyvly can offer landlords lower occupier turnover and therefore higher incomes as properties do not sit empty for any periods.	<triplet> Greg Marsh <sub> $4.6 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Mosaic Ventures <sub> $4.6 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Lyvly <sub> $4.6 million <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> $4.6 million <sub> Series A <obj> IN ROUND

But depending on the severity of the impact, it could result in a traumatic brain injury (TBI) – a common, underdiagnosed condition that can result in a range of cognitive and behavioural problems that make it difficult to lead a normal life. For example, studies have shown that around half of homeless men had suffered TBIs before becoming homeless. In Europe alone, head trauma is the because of about 2.5 million emergency room visits each year, roughly one million hospital admissions, nearly 75,000 deaths and approximately 100,000 cases of severe long-term disability (such as functional and cognitive disorders and learning disabilities). The global economic burden of TBI is estimated at about $400 billion when indirect costs such as productivity loss are taken into consideration.Würzburg-based vasopharm GmbH is a biopharmaceutical company developing a develop novel therapeutics to treat TBIs.

Existing investors Fly Ventures and Metavallon VC also participated. The UK-based agritech innovators are taking on a global challenge – feeding growing populations in a way that is sustainable and secure. The company aims to do this by turning the food supply chain from global to local, taking it back to the way nature intended. Founded in 2019, by CEO Fotis Fotiadis and CSO Miha Pipan, Better Origin is creating decentralised AI-powered insect mini-farms, which take local food waste from supermarkets and convert it into high-quality, sustainable animal feed. In doing so, the startup removes the need to ship animal feed around the world – tackling both the lack of sustainability, rising carbon footprints, and the lack of security that is inherent in the global food supply chain.	<triplet> Fly Ventures <sub> €14.6 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Metavallon VC <sub> €14.6 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Balderton Capital <sub> €14.6 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Better Originhas <sub> €14.6 million <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> €14.6 million <sub> Series A <obj> IN ROUND

522		Belgian startup Sodaannounced today  that it has raised €11.5 million in a Series A round to accelerate the development of its data monitoring platform, which streamlines how teams find data worth fixing. The round was led by leading European venture investor, Singular, with returning participation from seed investors Point Nine Capital, Hummingbird Ventures, DCF and angel investors. According toGartner’s Data Quality Market Survey, the average financial impact of bad data on organisations in 2017 was estimated to be around $15 million (€12.4 million) per year. This is because people across any business (such as data engineers, developers, data scientists, managers, senior executives) are all exposed to data, and use it as part of their roles every day. If data is incomplete or damaged, the time taken to correct the data is both time-consuming and costly. For Soda, maintaining data quality is a team sport that means everyone who has a stake in the data – and that is everyone in the business – needs to understand it, trust it, and stay on top of it. Soda’s mission is to bring everyone closer to trusted data. Raffi Kamber, General Partner at lead investor, Singular, said, “Analysis and usage of data has become business critical in most applications. Data quality needs to be preserved everywhere in a modern data stack, which is becoming increasingly massive and complex. A natural need has thus emerged for a platform that monitors data and provides a unified view of the data and its issues to all the stakeholders. That is what Soda is about, and Maarten and Tom bring deep expertise on this issue to the industry, their partners and customers.”	<triplet> Singular <sub> €11.5 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> angel investors <sub> €11.5 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Point Nine Capital <sub> €11.5 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> startup Sodaannounced <sub> €11.5 million <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> Hummingbird Ventures <sub> €11.5 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> DCF <sub> €11.5 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> €11.5 million <sub> Series A <obj> IN ROUND

Other investors to participate in the round are Possible Ventures, Kima Ventures, Quiet Ventures and Acequia Capital. The fresh capital will be used to expand its fully autonomous restaurant chain in France, and explore new locations in Europe. Cala has built the first fully robotic pasta restaurant in the world. The young company created a pasta-making robot to autonomously cook affordable, nutritious, sustainable and delicious meals, and transform the cost and experience of fast-casual dining. Founded in 2017 by engineering students, the idea for the company came from their own experiences in finding it hard to eat good quality and convenient food on a student budget and a belief that technology held the answer. Ylan Richard, Co-founder and CEO of Cala, said, “As students we were frustrated by the cost and lack of healthy meals available to us. Through our research, and driven by our own stomachs, we could see that the food service industry is broken. In fast food, the low-profit margin means that it is impossible to use higher quality ingredients. We realised that if you could automate the meal preparation, you could rapidly increase the number of meals being produced and improve the economics. We decided to focus on pasta as it can be customised and we could also reduce the number of meals that include meat, offering customers delicious food that is more sustainable, healthy and affordable. We have been building and iterating on our robot and our autonomous kitchen can now make 400 pasta dishes in one hour.”	<triplet> Acequia Capital <sub> €5.5 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> BACKED VC <sub> €5.5 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Possible Ventures <sub> €5.5 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Cala <sub> €5.5 million <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> Quiet Ventures <sub> €5.5 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Kima Ventures <sub> €5.5 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> €5.5 million <sub> Seed investment <obj> IN ROUND

681		PortfoLion has just invested €2 million in Codecool to boost its international expansion. Through this capital injection the Hungarian coding school can continue its growth in the most promising segment of the educational services market. The IT labour shortage in Hungary is currently estimated at 22.000 people, and this figure approaches 1 million in the EU as a whole. Experts agree that the problem of the recruitment of IT specialists is an existing, and probably long-term phenomenon. A qualified IT labour force has become the most important factor in the future success and business growth of enterprises not only in Hungary but globally, too. Recognizing this trend early on, in 2015 a group of Hungarian private individuals founded the Codecool IT specialist training company, which at the moment operates educational centres in Budapest (HU), Miskolc (HU) and Krakow (PL). Now in four grades, currently more than 300 students are taught programming as well as other skills ensuring their successful placement within the profession. During the Codecool course made up of 12 months of theoretical, and 6 months of practical elements, primarily 18-40-year-old career starters, or those switching careers, without any previous IT qualifications, are taught programming in coordination with the employer market, thereby guaranteeing graduates a job at the successful conclusion of the course. In addition to traditional secondary and higher education, this model supplies a high volume of recruits, which can be adjusted to specific corporate demands. The guarantee of a job and the post-financed training model are particularly attractive factors for applicants.	<triplet> Codecool <sub> €2 million <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> PortfoLion <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS
688		UK-based startupQuantum Motion, a quantum computing company founded on world-leading silicon spin tech developed at UCL and Oxford University, today announced it has completed an €9 million Series A round of investment. The startup will use the funds to continue its work to build a reasonably-sized ‘fault-tolerant’ quantum computer. Founded in 2017, Quantum Motion is led by founders Prof. Simon Benjamin (Oxford University) and Prof. John Morton (UCL) and commercial director Dr. James Palles- Dimmock. The team is working on a patented technology (silicon spin-based qubit architectures) which, for the quantum computing experts out there, are compatible with standard CMOS fabrication and so provide easier scaling to thousands and millions of qubits. Importantly, this technology will be used to make a fully functional, fault tolerant, quantum computer, and also gives the near-term opportunity of easy integration in a hybrid quantum/classical computer. Co-founder Prof. Benjamin comments“There are many ways to create a quantum computer, but to achieve true fault tolerance and thus explore the deepest and most powerful algorithms, electron spins in silicon may prove to be the best – or even the only – practical solution”.	<triplet> startupQuantum Motion <sub> €9 million <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> €9 million <sub> Series A <obj> IN ROUND

733		Lithuanian startup DappRadar, a platform for discovering and analysing blockchain-based decentralised applications (dapps), has raised €2.1 million in seed funding. The investment was led by Naspers, with participation from Blockchain.com Ventures and Angel Invest Berlin. DappRadar will use the investment primarily for R&D, developing new functionality to help the business expand its service and reach the next stage in its growth. Dapps are applications that run on peer-to-peer computer networks, rather than on centralised machines or servers. Their code is typically open source and the core function is handled by open source smart contracts deployed on a blockchain. Due to the nature of blockchain technology, a decentralised application’s data is transparent and cannot be tampered with, enabling the community to build on top of it without requiring permission. DappRadar tracks over 2,500 dapps across six blockchains, including Ethereum, EOS and TRON, with plans to expand to others. DappRadar filters through dapp data, removes fake and irrelevant activity and provides actionable market intelligence. Dapps are tracked in terms of their active users, token volume and transaction activity to provide insight into the trends in the dapp ecosystem. DappRadar has become the starting point for dapp discovery and acts as a distribution channel for dapp developers that are looking to reach new consumers.	<triplet> Naspers <sub> €2.1 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Blockchain.com Ventures <sub> €2.1 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> DappRadar <sub> €2.1 million <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> Angel Invest Berlin <sub> €2.1 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> €2.1 million <sub> seed funding <obj> IN ROUND

The round was led by Cemag Invest, as well as French Odyssée Ventures and AGIR à dom, and Indian investment firm ADAG. Diabeloop will put the funding towards commercialising their device across Europe and the US. Diabeloop, founded in 2015, offers a breakthrough in diabetes management. By leveraging artificial intelligence, treatment can be automated and personalised. Specifically, their ‘handset’ device uses sensors to measure blood sugar, and then pump a calculated dose of insulin to keep blood sugar at a healthy level. While Diabeloop’s device is known as a type of ‘artificial pancreas’, users need to manually tell the device when they eat.

94		Founded just four months ago, the Paris-based fintech startup PIXPAY has raised €3.1 million in a round led by Global Founders Capital. With the funding, PIXPAY intends to reinvent the way teenagers manage their budgets and spend their money in an economy where cash is disappearing, and build a European banking solution specifically for 10 to 18-year-olds. Traditional banks do not serve the needs of minors, often offering little more than an ATM card. Therefore, many adolescents are still dependent on their families to give them cash to spend, but this is not practical for online purchases, and for parents, cash has some downsides, such as the risk of loss or theft. To solve this problem, three parents, Benoit Grassin, Nicolas Klein (co-founders of the startup MonDocteur, which was sold to Doctolib in July 2018) and Caroline Ménager, decided to create PIXPAY. Their mission is to digitise spending for teens and parents, and with 30 million teenagers in Europe today, there is a large potential market.	<triplet> PIXPAY <sub> €3.1 million <obj> RECEIVES <triplet> Global Founders Capital <sub> €3.1 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> PIXPAY <sub> €3.1 million <obj> RECEIVES

The startup has just raised an additional €2.6 million from SEED Capital to boost its customer success platform for the professional services industry. Reducing client churn and maximising client upselling are crucial parts of any B2B company, and ‘customer success’ has been gaining traction as a fundamental part of business operations. To succeed in this, businesses need to analyse and be aware of proper and accurate metrics. Traditionally, the Net Promoter Score has been the leading customer health metric. Lift is on a mission to disrupt this approach and wants to establish their ‘Lift Score’ as the new standard to measure, predict and improve customer health. NPS has been criticised as neglecting to consider the complexity of B2B relationships with multiple stakeholders and their different needs. To get insights, companies who can afford it, engage with large consultancies like PWC to get a yearly report on customer sentiment and suggested actions. But, in a rapidly moving world, yearly input does not cut it.	<triplet> SEED Capital <sub> €2.6 million <obj> INVESTS <triplet> Lift Relations (Lift) <sub> €2.6 million <obj> RECEIVES
